# Sign & Verify Text

## Only Sign

By signing the text, you can show that you are the only and unchangeable certification with this text. You can just sign
the text without encrypting the text like the following.

## Sign With Encrypt

You can also encrypt this short text while signing, which is equivalent to signing while encrypting.

## Verify

After obtaining a plaintext and its signature, you can verify the signature.

## Verify With Decrypt

After obtaining a ciphertext, you can try to verify it while decrypting it. This is a good habit regardless of whether
the encryptor has signed in advance.
