# Translate Interface

GpgFrontend is designed to support multiple languages, but requires volunteer contributions to achieve this goal.
Fortunately, translation work does not require an understanding of difficult technology. Volunteers only need to move
their fingers to complete.

There are two ways to translate, through a translation tool with a GUI interface or directly through a text editor.

## Steps

1. Download or Clone Source Code [Here](https://github.com/saturneric/GpgFrontend)
2. You will find some ts files at path `GpgFrontend/resource/ts/`

### Use GUI Tools

1. [Download](https://github.com/lelegard/qtlinguist-installers/releases) QtLinguist Installer Here
2. Install the GUI Tool and Run it
3. Use GUI Tools to open ts File likes`gpgfrontend-en.ts` that you interest.
4. There is the [manual](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html) you may need to read.
5. Do the job and save your work in time.

### Use Text Editor

1. Use Text Editor to open ts File likes`gpgfrontend-en.ts` that you interest.
2. You may read [this document](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-ts-file-format.html) to understand the format of ts
   file.
3. Do the job and save your work in time.
